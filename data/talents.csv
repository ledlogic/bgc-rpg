|Talent|Description
|Acute Senses|One of your five senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) is extremely actue.  When using this specified sense, you will have a +3 bonus to Perception rolls for each level chosen.
|Ambidexterity|You can use tools and weapons with either hand at no penalty (normally -3 for using off-hand).

|Blind Reaction|You can counterattack (in hand to hand only) with no negative modifiers for darkness or being obscured (-4), even if you can't see or hear your opponent.
|Combat Sense|Your reflexes are keyed for danger; you automatically react faster to danger than anyone else; for every level taken you may add +1 to your Initiative rolls (in combat only). 
|Common Sense|You always look before you leap; the GM must give you warning whenever you’re about to do something particularly foolish, even if there are no perceptible clues present. He doesn’t have to specify the danger, just that "this might not be a smart idea..."
|Direction Sense|You are never lost, always know where North is and can orient yourself easily without any external cues.
|Double-Jointed|You can bend your limbs and joints in impossible ways. You can fit into any space equal to half your height and width and it is impossible to tie you up or entangle you with a single rope; you can only be restrained using restraints like cuffs, shackles, or nets.

|Knack|You have a natural knack or "gift" for performing certain kinds of tasks or activities (this could be Driving, Piloting, Firearms, or other skills, or even interpersonal abilities; you must choose one).  This Knack gives you a bonus of +1 for every level taken.
